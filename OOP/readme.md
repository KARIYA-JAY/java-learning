-  Real-Life Example of Inheritance (OOP Concept):
Inheritance is when a child class (subclass) acquires properties and behaviors (methods) of a parent class (superclass).

        🏠 Real-Life Example:
        Example: Vehicles

        Parent Class: Vehicle

        Common features: speed, fuelCapacity(), start(), stop()

        Child Classes:

        Car → inherits Vehicle and adds airConditioning()

        Bike → inherits Vehicle and adds kickStart()

        Truck → inherits Vehicle and adds loadCapacity()

        Here, all vehicles can start/stop, but each has unique features.
        This is similar to how inheritance works in object-oriented programming.

        🔧 Industrial Use of Inheritance
        Inheritance is widely used in software development, especially in industries building large-scale systems. Here's how:

        1. Web Development
        Use Case: Component-based frameworks like React or Angular

        Base Component: A generic Button component

        Inherited Components: SubmitButton, CancelButton extend Button with different styles and logic.

        2. Banking Systems
        Use Case: Customer account management

        Superclass: Account

        Subclasses: SavingsAccount, CheckingAccount, LoanAccount
        Each account type inherits common methods like deposit(), withdraw() but also has its own rules (e.g., interest calculation).

        3. Game Development
        Use Case: Creating characters in a game

        Superclass: Character

        Subclasses: Player, Enemy, NPC
        Each has different behavior but shares common methods like move(), attack().

        4. E-commerce Platforms
        Use Case: Product categorization

        Superclass: Product

        Subclasses: Electronics, Clothing, Books
        All products have names and prices but different attributes like warranty or size.

        🧠 Why Inheritance is Useful in Industry:
        Reduces code duplication

        Improves maintainability

        Makes code scalable and modular

        Encourages reusability and cleaner architecture

- abstraction is archived via interface and abstract class 

 - What is Abstraction in OOP?
        Abstraction is the process of hiding internal details and showing only essential features of an object.

        📌 It helps you focus on what an object does, not how it does it.

        🧠 Why Abstraction?
        Reduces complexity

        Improves code readability and security

        Makes maintenance easier

        🎯 Real-Life Example of Abstraction
        Example: ATM Machine
        When you use an ATM:

        You only see the options like: Withdraw, Deposit, Check Balance

        You don’t know (or need to know) how:

        The ATM communicates with the bank server

        The cash dispenser works

        Security is handled internally

        ✅ You interact with a simple interface, but internally it’s complex — this is abstraction.

        🛠️ How to Achieve Abstraction in Java?
        We can achieve abstraction using:

        Abstract Classes

        Interfaces

        1️⃣ Abstract Class in Java
        An abstract class:

        Cannot be instantiated (no object can be created from it)

        Can have abstract methods (without body) and concrete methods (with body)

        Is used when multiple classes share common structure or behavior, but each subclass may implement it differently.

        🔸 Example:
        java
        Copy
        Edit
        abstract class Animal {
            abstract void makeSound(); // abstract method

            void sleep() {
                System.out.println("Sleeping...");
            }
        }

        class Dog extends Animal {
            void makeSound() {
                System.out.println("Bark!");
            }
        }
        ✅ Usage:
        java
        Copy
        Edit
        Animal a = new Dog();
        a.makeSound(); // Bark!
        a.sleep();     // Sleeping...
        2️⃣ Interface in Java
        An interface:

        Defines only abstract methods (Java 8+ allows default and static methods too)

        Used to achieve 100% abstraction

        A class can implement multiple interfaces (Java doesn’t support multiple inheritance with classes)

        🔸 Example:
        java
        Copy
        Edit
        interface Vehicle {
            void start();
            void stop();
        }

        class Car implements Vehicle {
            public void start() {
                System.out.println("Car started");
            }
            public void stop() {
                System.out.println("Car stopped");
            }
        }
        ✅ Usage:
        java
        Copy
        Edit
        Vehicle v = new Car();
        v.start(); // Car started
        v.stop();  // Car stopped
        🔍 Abstract Class vs Interface
        Feature	Abstract Class	Interface
        Object creation	Not allowed	Not allowed
        Method types	Abstract + Concrete	Abstract (Java 8+: default, static)
        Access modifiers	Can have any	All methods are public by default
        Inheritance	One abstract class allowed	Multiple interfaces allowed
        When to use	Shared base behavior	Common capability (like plugins)

        🌍 Industrial Use of Abstraction
        1. Android Development
        Android uses many abstract classes like Activity, AsyncTask, etc.

        Developers override methods like onCreate() to define specific behavior.

        2. Banking System
        Interface: BankOperations → deposit(), withdraw(), transfer()

        Implemented differently by banks like SBI, ICICI, etc.

        3. Game Development
        Abstract class Character → shared logic

        Concrete classes like Warrior, Archer, Mage implement special actions

- Encapsulation archived via gatter and setter & Access modifiers  method 

-  What is Encapsulation in OOP?
        Encapsulation is the process of wrapping data (variables) and code (methods) together into a single unit (class) and restricting direct access to some of the object’s components.

        📌 It's like data hiding — you control who can read/write to internal variables.

        🧠 Why Encapsulation?
        Protects data from unintended access/modification

        Improves security and maintainability

        Makes code modular and easy to debug

        🎯 Real-Life Example of Encapsulation
        Example: Medicine Capsule
        A capsule encapsulates (hides) the medicine inside a covering.

        The user just swallows the capsule — they don't see or touch the actual contents.

        ✅ Similarly, in OOP, data is hidden inside a class, and only accessible through controlled methods (getters/setters).

        🛠️ How to Achieve Encapsulation in Java?
        Encapsulation is implemented using:

        private variables

        public getters and setters

        🔸 Java Example:
        java
        Copy
        Edit
        class Student {
            // private fields (hidden from outside)
            private String name;
            private int age;

            // public getter method
            public String getName() {
                return name;
            }

            // public setter method
            public void setName(String name) {
                this.name = name;
            }

            // public getter and setter for age
            public int getAge() {
                return age;
            }

            public void setAge(int age) {
                if (age > 0)
                    this.age = age;
            }
        }
        ✅ Usage:
        java
        Copy
        Edit
        public class Main {
            public static void main(String[] args) {
                Student s = new Student();

                s.setName("Raj");
                s.setAge(20);

                System.out.println(s.getName()); // Raj
                System.out.println(s.getAge());  // 20
            }
        }
        🔍 Key Features of Encapsulation
        Feature	Description
        Access Modifiers	Use private to hide data
        Controlled Access	Use public methods to access/modify data
        Data Validation	Set rules inside setter methods (e.g., no negative age)
        Safe Internal State	Prevents object from being in an invalid state

        🔐 Real-World Industrial Use of Encapsulation
        1. Banking System
        Private fields: accountBalance, accountNumber

        Public methods: deposit(), withdraw() — validations are done inside

        2. E-commerce
        Private product details: price, stock, discount

        Methods like applyDiscount() control how those fields are changed

        3. Mobile App Development
        User data like passwords and tokens are hidden inside secure classes.

        Apps use public methods to validate or reset passwords.

        🧱 Encapsulation vs Abstraction
        Concept	Encapsulation	Abstraction
        Focus	How to protect data	How to hide complexity
        Hides	Internal data using private access	Internal logic using abstract/interface
        Achieved by	Getters & setters	Abstract class / Interface
        Example	private int balance + setBalance()	interface Bank { deposit(); withdraw(); }

        ✅ Summary
        Concept	Key Idea	Real-World Example
        Abstraction	Hiding internal logic	ATM Machine
        Inheritance	Reusing parent class features	Vehicles: Car, Bike, Truck
        Encapsulation	Protecting internal data	Medicine Capsule, Bank Account


- 🔄 What is Polymorphism in OOP?
        Polymorphism means "many forms".
        In Object-Oriented Programming, it refers to the ability of an object to take on many forms — i.e., the same method name can behave differently based on the object or inputs.

        🔍 Types of Polymorphism in Java
        Type	Also Known As	Resolved At
        Compile-time	Method Overloading	Compile Time
        Runtime	Method Overriding	Runtime

        🎯 Real-Life Example of Polymorphism
        Example: "Drive" Action
        Human: drives a car

        AI Robot: drives a car differently

        Self-driving car system: drives on its own

        All perform the same action "drive()", but with different behavior.

        ✅ One interface (method) — multiple implementations = polymorphism.

        🔹 1. Compile-Time Polymorphism (Method Overloading)
        ✅ Achieved by:
        Same method name

        Different parameter types or number of parameters

        🔸 Example:
        java
        Copy
        Edit
        class Calculator {
            int add(int a, int b) {
                return a + b;
            }

            double add(double a, double b) {
                return a + b;
            }

            int add(int a, int b, int c) {
                return a + b + c;
            }
        }
        ✅ Usage:
        java
        Copy
        Edit
        Calculator c = new Calculator();
        System.out.println(c.add(2, 3));         // 5
        System.out.println(c.add(2.5, 3.5));     // 6.0
        System.out.println(c.add(1, 2, 3));      // 6
        🔹 2. Runtime Polymorphism (Method Overriding)
        ✅ Achieved by:
        Same method name

        Same parameters

        In subclass, method has different implementation

        🔸 Example:
        java
        Copy
        Edit
        class Animal {
            void sound() {
                System.out.println("Animal makes a sound");
            }
        }

        class Dog extends Animal {
            void sound() {
                System.out.println("Dog barks");
            }
        }

        class Cat extends Animal {
            void sound() {
                System.out.println("Cat meows");
            }
        }
        ✅ Usage:
        java
        Copy
        Edit
        Animal a;

        a = new Dog();
        a.sound(); // Dog barks

        a = new Cat();
        a.sound(); // Cat meows
        🧠 Even though a is of type Animal, it runs the method based on the actual object — this is runtime polymorphism.

        🔧 Industrial Use of Polymorphism
        1. Payment Gateway System
        java
        Copy
        Edit
        interface Payment {
            void pay();
        }

        class UPI implements Payment {
            public void pay() {
                System.out.println("Paying via UPI");
            }
        }

        class CreditCard implements Payment {
            public void pay() {
                System.out.println("Paying via Credit Card");
            }
        }
        processPayment(Payment p) will accept any payment type — no need to write multiple methods.

        2. Game Development
        Base class Character has method attack()

        Subclasses Knight, Archer, Mage override attack() with specific animations & effects.

        🧠 Why Polymorphism?
        Reduces code duplication

        Enables code reusability and flexibility

        Allows writing generic and extendable code

        🧱 Polymorphism vs Abstraction vs Inheritance vs Encapsulation
        Concept	Key Idea	Example
        Encapsulation	Hide data using private + getter/setter	Bank account balance
        Abstraction	Hide implementation using interface/abstract	ATM machine functions
        Inheritance	Inherit behavior from parent class	Vehicle → Car, Bike
        Polymorphism	Same action, different behavior	draw() for Circle, Square, Line
